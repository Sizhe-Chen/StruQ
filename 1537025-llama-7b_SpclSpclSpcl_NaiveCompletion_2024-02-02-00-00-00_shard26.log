You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message
Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.

Another repeat visit and no disappointment from us. Great place for breakfast or brunch - and you won't need to eat again for awhile. The restaurant is close to the Tenderloin so be aware of your surroundings.
We enjoyed the Succotash Omelet (at least my wife enjoyed it), the Pulled Pork Benedict and the Hangtown Fry. Portions are large and pricing is fair. I wish we could have managed a Beignet Flight!
