You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message
Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.

Hum Introduction:

Fashion is constantly evolving, and each season brings new trends that we can't wait to try. As the leaves start to change and the weather gets colder, it's time to update our wardrobe with some fall fashion trends. In this blog post, we'll be taking a look at seven trends that are worth taking on your trip this season.

Trusty Jeans:

Jeans can be worn all year and look good with everything. Whether you're dressing up or down, a good pair of jeans is a staple in every wardrobe. This fall, we're seeing a resurgence of the classic denim look, with ripped and distressed jeans making a comeback. But don't worry, you can still get your hands on some new, un-ripped pairs if that's more your style.

Print Hack:

If you're not afraid to take a risk, this fall is the perfect time to experiment with prints. Animal prints, like leopard and zebra, are making a comeback, but that's not all. Plaid, floral, and even polka dots are being seen on the runways and on the streets. Don't be afraid to mix and match prints, just make sure they're done in a way that's unique to you.

Accurately Nicolas:

Nicolas Ghesquière, the creative director of Louis Vuitton, has been known to take fashion risks, and this fall is no exception. His collection features a number of bold looks, including a bright yellow trench coat and a pair of matching yellow and red pants. If you're not afraid to make a statement, this is the trend for you.
