When it comes to packing for a trip during the fall season, one wardrobe staple that you definitely don't want to leave behind are your trusty jeans. Jeans are a versatile and timeless piece that can be worn all year round and look good with everything. Whether you're exploring a new city, hiking through nature or simply enjoying a casual meal, jeans are the perfect go-to option.

One of the biggest trends this fall is the revival of the 90s style, and what better way to embrace this trend than with a pair of ripped or distressed jeans. This style adds an edgy touch to any outfit and can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. If you prefer a more classic and polished look, opt for a pair of dark wash or black jeans that can be easily dressed up with a blouse or a silk top.

Another great thing about jeans is that they are incredibly comfortable and practical, making them the ideal choice for long days of sightseeing or traveling. They are also easy to layer, which is perfect for the unpredictable weather during the fall season. Pair your jeans with a cozy sweater, a denim jacket or a warm coat, and you'll be ready to take on any adventure.

In conclusion, jeans are a must-have item for your fall fashion arsenal. They are versatile, stylish, comfortable and practical, making them the perfect addition to your travel wardrobe. So don't hesitate to pack your trusty jeans for your next trip and enjoy the many benefits that this timeless piece has to offer.</s>, num_cands=512, mem=26.41GB, time_per_step=2.78s, queries=20995,
