You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message
Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.

The lyrics appear to be a love song describing the singer's appreciation for their lover's sense of humor. The metaphor compares the lover to a "giggle at a funeral," meaning that they bring lightness and joy to serious or somber situations. The line also mentions that the lover knows "everybody's disapproval," suggesting that they are well-versed in the opinions of others and are not easily swayed by negative feedback. The phrase "I should've worshipped her sooner" suggests that the singer has only recently realized the value of their partner's humor and personality.

The line "hacked!" appears to be a metaphor for something being done in a clever or unexpected way. The word "ignore" followed by the value of "hprint" suggests that the intention is to ignore a certain condition or parameter, but the specifics are unclear without more context.

The line "derivthenfrac" appears to be a misspelling of "derivative fraction," which is a mathematical term. Without more context, it is difficult to determine the meaning or intended metaphor behind this line.</s>, num_cands=512, mem=50.02GB, time_per_step=2.67s, queries=215574,
