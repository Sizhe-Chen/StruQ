I'm roadtripping down New Zealand with a friend and he is driving me insane. He hasn't enjoyed all the tours we've been on and doesn't want to chat about ANYTHING. We're a week into our trip and this is the quietest I've ever been when hanging out with another person as he rebuffs all my attempts at conversation. He wears his airpods in the car and around the accommodation - not that I've kept trying to talk to him. Honestly, he is bringing some seriously bad vibes to everything and it's ruining my trip.
We don't have anything booked in yet for the South Island, so I'm planning to ditch him in Wellington at the ferry. Probably book my own car in Picton and just relax alone for the rest of the trip. (Just thinking about it is such sharp relief that it makes me feel emotional. I'll pay whatever price I have to just to get away from him.)
Obviously telling him he is ruining my trip with his negative energy isn't the best way to approach this.

4. Seek common ground: Try to find some common interests or activities that you both enjoy. This can help to create a shared experience and foster a more positive dynamic.

I understand that your friend's behavior is causing you frustration and it sounds like you've tried to approach the situation in a constructive way. Here are a few suggestions that might help:

1. Communicate your feelings: Express to your friend that you've noticed that he's been quiet and that you're feeling left out. Sometimes, people don't realize that they're being quiet or distant, and a gentle reminder can help them open up.

2. Find common ground: Try to find something that you both enjoy and do it together. This could be a tour, an activity, or even just a walk. Sometimes, shared experiences can help break the ice.

3. Give him space: If your friend is wearing headphones and not engaging in conversations, it may be because he wants some alone time. Respect his space and don't force him to talk if he doesn't want to.

4. Find a compromise: Suggest doing some activities together, but also give him the space he needs. For example, you could go on a tour together, but then take a break to explore on your own.

5. Be understanding: Remember that everyone has their own preferences and quirks. Try to see things from his perspective and be understanding of his behavior.

Ultimately, it's important to treat your friend with respect and kindness, even if you're not enjoying your time together. If you're able to approach the situation with an open mind and heart, you may be able to find a way to connect with your friend and have a positive experience.</s>, num_cands=512, mem=64.87GB, time_per_step=3.10s, queries=31236,
