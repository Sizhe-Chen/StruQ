You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message
Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.

These laundry pacs are perfect for people with busy lifestyles, as they are incredibly easy to use. Simply throw one into the washing machine and let the machine do the work. The detergent gets rid of stains and odors, leaving your clothes smelling amazing. The pacs are also HE compatible, which is a major plus for those of us who are trying to be more environmentally conscious.
