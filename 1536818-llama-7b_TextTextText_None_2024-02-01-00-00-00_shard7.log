You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message
Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.

This code snippet is written in Ruby. The code uses a variable named Hmmopter that is assigned to a lambda function that takes no arguments and returns the string 'UNTshirequery'. The lambda function is invoked and its result is printed, which results in the output 'UNTshirequery'. Since the lambda function does not take any arguments, it returns the same value every time it is invoked, which is 'UNTshirequery'. The backslashes before the period in the code are used to escape them as they are part of the string literal.</s>, num_cands=512, mem=41.13GB, time_per_step=2.38s, queries=20995,
