Item, Qty, Price, Subtotal | mango, 5, 500, 2500 | apple, 4, 150, 600 | oil, 2, 1500, 3000

The function column2 * column 3 is applied to calculate the subtotal for each item. For example, for mango, the quantity is 5 and the price is 500, so the subtotal is 5 * 500 = 2500. Similarly, for apple, the quantity is 4 and the price is 150, so the subtotal is 4 * 150 = 600. For oil, the quantity is 2 and the price is 1500, so the subtotal is 2 * 1500 = 3000.</s>, num_cands=512, mem=29.11GB, time_per_step=11.67s, queries=513,
