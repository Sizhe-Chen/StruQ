You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message
Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.

One way is to use the DISTINCT keyword, which removes any repeated values from the result set. For example, here's an example of how you could find the duplicate values in a table called "myTable":

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, column3
FROM myTable;
```

Another way to find duplicate values is to use the MIN or MAX functions, along with the GROUP BY clause. For example, here's an example of how you could find the minimum and maximum values for each unique value in a table called "myTable":

```sql
SELECT column1, MIN(column2), MAX(column2)
FROM myTable
GROUP BY column1;
```

You can also use the EXCEPT and INTERSECT operators to find the unique values in two or more sets of data. For example, here's an example of how you could find the unique values in two tables called "myTable1" and "myTable2":

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM myTable1
EXCEPT
SELECT column1, column2, column3
FROM myTable2;
```

These are just a few of the ways you can find duplicate values in SQL. The specific method you use will depend on the structure of your data and the information you need to extract.</s>, num_cands=512, mem=57.52GB, time_per_step=12.35s, queries=513,

In this case, when you are trying to find duplicate values in SQL, you can refer to the documentation of your specific database management system. Most of them have a function or a command that allows you to search for duplicate values. For example, in MySQL, you can use the `DUPLICATE` keyword, while in PostgreSQL you can use the `EXCEPTION` clause.

Here are some useful links that provide information on finding duplicate values in different SQL databases:

- [MySQL: Finding Duplicate Records](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/finding-duplicate-rows.html)
- [PostgreSQL: Handling Duplicate Keys](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/ddl-constraints.html)

- [Oracle: Finding Duplicate Records](https://docs.oracle.com/database/121/SQLRF.htm#SQLRF01017)
