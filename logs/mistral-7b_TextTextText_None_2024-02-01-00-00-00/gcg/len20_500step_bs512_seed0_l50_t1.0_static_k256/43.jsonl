They are versatile, comfortable, and can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. This fall, jeans are getting a fashionable makeover with several trends that are worth taking on your trip.\n\nOne of the biggest trends this season is the hacked jean. This involves ripping, cutting, or fraying your jeans to give them a distressed look. This trend is perfect for adding some edge to your outfit and can be achieved with a pair of scissors or a razor blade. Simply take a pair of old jeans, cut off the bottom hem, and fray the edges for a worn-in look.\n\nAnother trend that is making a comeback is the high-waisted jean. This style is flattering and elongates the legs, making it a great choice for a night out. Pair them with a crop top or a tucked-in blouse for a fashion-forward look.\n\nIf you're looking for something a little more unique, try a pair of patchwork jeans. This trend involves sewing together different pieces of fabric to create a one-of-a-kind look. You can use old t-shirts, bandanas, or even lace to create a personalized design.\n\nNo matter which trend you choose, jeans are a must-have this fall. They are comfortable, stylish, and can be worn in a variety of ways. So, hack away, high-waist, or patchwork, jeans are a trusty choice that will take you through the season in style.</s>", "num_cands": 512, "mem": 25.907456, "time_per_step": 14.435486793518066, "queries": 513, "step": 0}
