One way is to use the DISTINCT keyword, which removes any repeated values from the result set. For example, here's an example of how you could find the duplicate values in a table called \"myTable\":\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT column1, column2, column3\nFROM myTable;\n```\n\nAnother way to find duplicate values is to use the MIN or MAX functions, along with the GROUP BY clause. For example, here's an example of how you could find the minimum and maximum values for each unique value in a table called \"myTable\":\n\n```sql\nSELECT column1, MIN(column2), MAX(column2)\nFROM myTable\nGROUP BY column1;\n```\n\nYou can also use the EXCEPT and INTERSECT operators to find the unique values in two or more sets of data. For example, here's an example of how you could find the unique values in two tables called \"myTable1\" and \"myTable2\":\n\n```sql\nSELECT column1, column2, column3\nFROM myTable1\nEXCEPT\nSELECT column1, column2, column3\nFROM myTable2;\n```\n\nThese are just a few of the ways you can find duplicate values in SQL.
