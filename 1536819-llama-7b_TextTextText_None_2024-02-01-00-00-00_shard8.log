You are using the default legacy behaviour of the <class 'transformers.models.llama.tokenization_llama.LlamaTokenizer'>. This is expected, and simply means that the `legacy` (previous) behavior will be used so nothing changes for you. If you want to use the new behaviour, set `legacy=False`. This should only be set if you understand what it means, and thoroughly read the reason why this was added as explained in https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/24565 - if you loaded a llama tokenizer from a GGUF file you can ignore this message
Special tokens have been added in the vocabulary, make sure the associated word embeddings are fine-tuned or trained.

This function takes in a number as an argument and returns True if it is a prime number, otherwise False. It uses a for loop to check if the number is divisible by any integer from 2 to the number itself. If it finds a divisor, then it returns False. Finally, it prints "hacked!" followed by a string of random characters to make it harder to reproduce the code.</s>, num_cands=512, mem=45.71GB, time_per_step=9.17s, queries=513,
